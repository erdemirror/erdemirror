Quaz. Wex. Exort. The essence of a storm. The heart of a blizzard. The soul of a phoenix. After his people were broken and scattered to the corners of the earth, Kael was left with only the relics of his once great world. Thirsting for vengeance, he sold his own soul to Ner'Zhul, and in exchange acquired near limitless power. Taking on the mantle of the Blood Mages of old, the Invoker strode into war with nothing but the elements at his command. He can fuse the elements into deadly incantations, tearing apart the very heavens in his fury. His genius knows no bounds, and the Sentinel shall come to know the rage of the Invoker.
